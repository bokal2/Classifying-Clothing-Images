# Classifying-Clothing-Images
A Neural Network project to classify images of clothing, like sneakers, coats, trousers, bags and shirts.

In this project we use tf.keras, a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow.

Dependencies to be intalled: tensorflow, tensorflow dataset, NumPY, Matplotlib

Dataset: Fashion MNIST dataset. Link: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

Key Concepts

Flattening: The process of converting 2d images into 1d vector

ReLU: An activation function that allows a model to solve Non-Linear problems

Softmax: A function that provides probabilities for each possible output class

Classification: A machine learning model used for distinguishing among two or more outpu categories.
